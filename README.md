# PhotoScraper

This script creates a directory named 'images'.
Then subdirectories are created with the keyword they entered followed by the serial number of the images as its name, and the photos are downloaded into the respective subdirectories.


#### NOTE: In line 71, the path of the output directory is set to my accordance. If you wish to use this code, you will have to change the first part of the path to the name of the directory you are storing this script in. Eg- If you are naming your main directory as 'scraper' then the path should be 'scraper/images/{keyword}'.

I do not have any problem with anyone using my code for education purposes, however, I would highly appreciate it if you mention this repository as well.
